# Codechef-feb-long-challenge-2019
  Problem statement 1 :)
     Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are N problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between 1 and N inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them â€• Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by A but not divisible by B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by B but not divisible by A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both A and B

To win, it is necessary to solve at least K
problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.
