  Problem statement 1 :)
     Appy and Chef are participating in a contest. There are N problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between 1 and N inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them ― Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by A but not divisible by B, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by B but not divisible by A (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both A and B

To win, it is necessary to solve at least K
problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.

   Problem statement 2 :)
      Chef recently visited ShareChat Cafe and was highly impressed by the food. Being a food enthusiast, he decided to enquire about the ingredients of each dish.

There are N
dishes represented by strings S1,S2,…,SN. Each ingredient used for making dishes in ShareChat Cafe is represented by a lowercase English letter. For each valid i, the ingredients used to make dish i correspond to characters in the string Si

(note that ingredients may be used multiple times). A special ingredient is an ingredient which is present in each dish at least once.

Chef wants to know the number of special ingredients in ShareChat Cafe. Since Chef is too busy with work, can you help him?
